# Handwritten Digit Recognition

Deep Learning model for Handwritten Digit Recognition using TensorFlow and Neural Network Techniques

## 1. Problem Definition â›‘

Recognise handwritten digit, from a dataset which contains B&W images of each digit written on 28x28 pixel box, given by [The MNIST DATABASE](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## 2. Dataset

The data we're using is officially provided by [The MNIST DATABASE](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

The digits have been sized-normalized and centered in a fixed-sized image.

The data is quite preprocessed and well-formatted.

## 3. Evaluation
Accuracy should be above 95%.

## 4. Features
Some information about the data,
* We're dealing with images(unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning technique to solve this problem.
* There are around a 60,000 examples of training set. 
* There are around a 10,000 examples of test set.

## 5. Model/Estimator
Neural Network Multi-class Classification Model

## 6. Results
`Last Successful Run`: **Accuracy** was **96%**
